This repository is for my articles of Async and Multithread programing.
In this series, I dive into the fundamentals of asynchronous and multithreading programming, exploring their relationship with hardware and how they can optimize computing resources.

- 1. [What is asynchronous programming? (JavaScript)](https://brycemeng.com/async-and-multithread-programming-1-async-en.html)
  - 1.1 How to perform asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
- 2. Asynchronous programming in other languages
- 3. Multithreading programming (C++) 
  - a.What is multithreading? What is its relationship with hardware?
  - b.What does it mean to use multithreading?
  - c.What is the goal of using multithreading?
- 4. Multithreading programming in other languages
- 5.The relationship between multithreading and asynchronous programming (mainly discussing GoRoutine, analyzing the source code, and examining if Rust has made improvements)
- 6.GPU parallel programming
